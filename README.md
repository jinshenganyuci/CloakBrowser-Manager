Each profile is an isolated CloakBrowser instance with its own fingerprint, proxy, cookies, and session data. Profiles persist across restarts. Everything runs in one Docker container.

```bash
docker run --init -p 8080:8080 -v cloakprofiles:/data \
  -e KEEPASSXC_DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-database-secret \
  cloakhq/cloakbrowser-manager
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser-Manager.git
cd CloakBrowser-Manager
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. Create a profile. Click Launch. Done.

> **Early alpha** — this project is under active development. Expect bugs. If you find one, please [open an issue](https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser-Manager/issues).

## Why Not Just Use a VPN?

A VPN only changes your IP. Incognito only clears cookies. Chrome profiles share the same hardware fingerprint underneath. Platforms use 50+ signals to link your accounts — canvas, WebGL, audio, GPU, fonts, screen size, timezone.

Each CloakBrowser profile generates a completely different device identity. To the website, each profile looks like a different computer.

| Solution | What it changes | Accounts linked? |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| VPN | IP address only | Yes — same fingerprint |
| Incognito | Clears cookies | Yes — same fingerprint |
| Chrome profiles | Separate bookmarks/cookies | Yes — same hardware fingerprint |
| **CloakBrowser** | **Everything — full device identity per profile** | **No** |

## Features

- **Profile management** — create, edit, delete browser profiles with unique fingerprints
- **Per-profile settings** — fingerprint seed, proxy, timezone, locale, user agent, screen size, platform
- **One-click launch/stop** — each profile runs as an isolated CloakBrowser instance
- **Session persistence** — cookies, localStorage, and cache survive browser restarts
- **Passkey support** — each profile can run an isolated KeePassXC database through the bundled KeePassXC-Browser extension
- **In-browser viewing** — interact with launched browsers via noVNC, directly in the web GUI
- **Playwright/Puppeteer API** — connect to any running profile programmatically via CDP, while still watching it live in the browser
- **Optional authentication** — protect the web UI and API with a single token, or run wide open locally
- **Powered by CloakBrowser** — 32 source-level C++ patches, passes Cloudflare Turnstile, 0.9 reCAPTCHA v3 score

## Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Browser viewer**: noVNC (WebSocket-based VNC client)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Browser engine**: [CloakBrowser](https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser) (stealth Chromium binary)

## Development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The included Compose configuration uses `change-me-keepassxc` as a development
default for `KEEPASSXC_DATABASE_PASSWORD`. Set a private value before production
use:

```bash
export KEEPASSXC_DATABASE_PASSWORD='replace-with-a-strong-secret'
docker compose up --build
```

New profiles include both `--disable-extensions-except` and `--load-extension`
arguments for the bundled KeePassXC-Browser extension. The first overrides
CloakBrowser's extension-disable default; the second loads the unpacked
extension and is also the KeePassXC lifecycle switch. Removing the
`--load-extension=/opt/cloakbrowser/extensions/keepassxc-browser` argument
prevents KeePassXC from starting for that profile. Each enabled profile stores
its database and KeePassXC configuration under
`/data/profiles/<profile-id>/KeePassXC`.

The manager reads the database password once at startup, removes it from its
child-process environment, and sends it to KeePassXC only through standard
input. Changing the environment value does not re-encrypt existing databases;
profiles created with the old value will fail to start until the matching
password is restored or their database is re-encrypted manually.

For profiles using KeePassXC, the browser viewer toolbar includes a key button.
It brings KeePassXC to the front and fills the VNC display; clicking it again
while KeePassXC has focus hides all of its windows, then restores, fills, and
focuses that profile's Chromium window. Profiles without the bundled extension
load argument do not show this button.

Non-headless Chromium windows are also restored, positioned at the display
origin, filled to the configured VNC resolution, and focused after launch.

The Compose service uses `init: true`, and direct `docker run` examples use
`--init`, so PID 1 reaps orphaned Chromium, Crashpad, KeePassXC Browser Proxy,
and clipboard helper processes. Recreate existing containers after upgrading;
restarting a container created without an init process does not add one.

The image uses KeePassXC 2.7.12 from its checksum-pinned official x86_64
AppImage. Its bundled Qt runtime avoids the reproducible system-Qt crash that
can occur when a distro build is unlocked with `--pw-stdin` as a background
process. KeePassXC does not currently publish a Linux arm64 AppImage, so this
Docker build targets amd64 rather than silently falling back to the affected
distro runtime.

## Requirements

- Docker (20.10+)
- ~2 GB disk (image + binary)
- ~512 MB RAM per running profile

## Updating

Pull the latest image and restart:

```bash
docker pull cloakhq/cloakbrowser-manager
docker stop <container-id>
docker run --init -p 8080:8080 -v cloakprofiles:/data \
  -e KEEPASSXC_DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-database-secret \
  cloakhq/cloakbrowser-manager
```

Your profiles and session data are stored in the `cloakprofiles` volume and persist across updates.

## Automation API

Every running profile exposes a CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) endpoint. Connect Playwright or Puppeteer to automate a profile while watching it live in the browser.

```python
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async with async_playwright() as pw:
    browser = await pw.chromium.connect_over_cdp(
        "http://localhost:8080/api/profiles/<profile-id>/cdp"
    )
    page = browser.contexts[0].pages[0]
    await page.goto("https://example.com")
```

```javascript
const { chromium } = require("playwright");

const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(
  "http://localhost:8080/api/profiles/<profile-id>/cdp"
);
const page = browser.contexts()[0].pages()[0];
await page.goto("https://example.com");
```

The CDP URL is available in the toolbar (code icon) when a profile is running. The same browser session is accessible both visually through VNC and programmatically through the API.

## Remote Access

The container binds to localhost only. To access from a remote server:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 your-server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

## Authentication

By default, there is no authentication (ideal for local use). To protect the web UI and API when hosting on a network, set the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
docker run --init -p 8080:8080 -v cloakprofiles:/data \
  -e AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-token \
  -e KEEPASSXC_DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-database-secret \
  cloakhq/cloakbrowser-manager
```

Or in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-token
  - KEEPASSXC_DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-database-secret
```

When `AUTH_TOKEN` is set:

- The web UI shows a login page. Enter the token to unlock.
- API consumers pass the token via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- VNC WebSocket connections are authenticated via the login cookie.
- The `/api/status` endpoint remains unauthenticated (for Docker healthcheck).

> **Note**: The auth token is transmitted in cleartext over HTTP. If you expose the Manager to the internet, put it behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS (Caddy, nginx, Traefik).
